# ðŸŒŸ Staking

The start of work on the staking system began in early June and after many tests to increase the security of the contract, it was released in late July.&#x20;

The **staking** system was such that by staking your NFT in the contract, you get the profit of every transaction in the game, **nothing or double** It happens and you can take your NFT out of the stake mode whenever you like.&#x20;

To play **nothing or double** you had an equal chance of doubling your Matic or doubling it or losing to the pool, in this system you had a 50/50 chance of winning or losing.&#x20;

3 versions of the nothing or double game were released, which were very well received. More than 300 NFTs were staked in this system, which had a very positive effect on the value of NFTs in the market.
