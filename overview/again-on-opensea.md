# ðŸŒ” Again on Opensea

Almost less than a month is left until the **anniversary** of the start of the Polygonapes project. Today, on 12/09/2022, when we are writing this article, we have experienced many ups and downs on our way, sometimes we are discouraged and sometimes with a positive comment. We have gained strength that we have continued to work energetically for weeks, it is time to take another step to answer the trust of the community during this 1 year.



### AZW

We are proud to announce that in order to compensate for Opensea's problem and improve the quality of Polygonapes' NFT collection, as well as **re-listing in Opensea**, we intend to use NFT better in a First Person Shooter - FPS game under the title of Zone with polls and community approval. War Ape, with the abbreviation **AWZ**, change the smart contract and transfer the same NFT to all Polygonapes holders in the new contract in a snapshot, so that from now on in the new contract, they can easily buy and sell in Opensea and enjoy its benefits.
