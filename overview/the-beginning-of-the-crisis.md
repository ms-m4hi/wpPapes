# ðŸ˜• The beginning of the crisis

No, this should not have happened. By the time everything had been lifted from the heavy burden of copying and the mint process had resumed, the Polygonapes page in Opensea was unavailable.&#x20;

Despite the challenge, our team and the communication with Opensea, no action was taken to return the account from Opensea and the Polygonapes community was very upset because of the importance they know to the Opensea website. Our team tried very hard to compensate for Opensea's problem by replacing other marketplaces that were on Polygon blockchain, for this reason we listed the project in 3 other marketplaces: **Rarible**, **Luxy, NFT Apparel.**

Partnership with **Metapetz**, **Polydoge** After the big crisis in Opensea, after some time, the team returned to its activities after sorting out the situation and started partnership and collaboration with other Polygan projects with strength.

&#x20;Because we believe that we are responsible for those who have invested in our project and we must be accountable to them, we will never stop moving forward and continue with strength.
