# ðŸ¤‘ Referral and Earn

Are you a PolygonApes NFT holder? Now you can earn rewards just by sharing your wallet address! Here's how it works:

> If you're a holder of a PolygonApes NFT in previous contract, you can now share your wallet address with others and earn rewards. By sharing your wallet address as a referral, anyone who mints a new PolygonApes NFT using your address will earn you **10 MATIC for each minting**. Not only that, but they will also receive a **10 MATIC discount** on their minting cost. So, it's a win-win situation for both the referral and the referrer.
